# Rekado
Fusee launcher writtern in Kotlin and based on [NXLoader](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/NXLoader) injector codebase. 

**Application doesn't require Root on your device.**

[SX OS (1.2)](https://sx.xecuter.com/) payload bundled as default.

## Usage
* Launch application
* Find a cable to connect your device to the Nintendo Switch. For proper work, this should be a cable that is designed for data transmission, not just for charging. It is advisable to use an **A-to-C** cable and an **USB OTG** adapter.
* In the **"Payloads"** category, click the **"+"** button to select preloaded payload from your device's storage. Or simply transfer your payload to the Rekado folder in the device's memory. Or you can use the default payload (**SX OS**)
* Enter your Nintendo Switch into **RCM** mode in any convenient way. Your Nintendo Switch will power on by itself when plugged in, be sure to hold **VOLUME +**
* Connect the device to the Nintendo Switch and allow permission for the **USB** access if necessary. Wait until the program prompts you to select payload and choose the one you need
* Wait for payload to finish loading on your console

## Download
You can get application's APK from Releases form in this repository.

## FAQ
**Does application require Root?**

Application doesn't require Root on your device.

**Can it brick my device/console?**

This should not happen when using the "correct" loaders. But I am not responsible for possible problems.

**Will Recado ever run Linux?**

In the near future, this is definitely not to be expected. Maybe in the future.

## Thanks
* [DavidBuchanan314](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314) for creating NXLoader.
