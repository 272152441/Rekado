# Rekado
Payload launcher written in Kotlin for Nintendo Switch.

**Application doesn't require Root on your device.**

[SX Loader](https://sx.xecuter.com/), [ReiNX](https://reinx.guide/) and [Hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate) payloads bundled as default.

## Usage
* Launch application.
* Find a cable to connect your device to the Nintendo Switch. For proper work, this should be a cable that is designed for data transmission, not just for charging. It is advisable to use an **A-to-C** cable and an **USB OTG** adapter.
* In the **"Payloads"** category, click the **"+"** button to select preloaded payload from your device's storage. Or simply transfer your payload to the Rekado folder in the device's memory. Or you can use the bundled payloads (**SX Loader/ReiNX/Hekate**).
* Enter your Nintendo Switch into **RCM** mode in any convenient way. Your Nintendo Switch will power on by itself when plugged in, be sure to hold **VOLUME +**.
* Connect the device to the Nintendo Switch and allow permission for the **USB** access if necessary. Wait unit payloads chooser dialog will be opened and select which one you want to load.
* Wait for payload to finish loading on your console.

## Download

## Localization
All localization files moved to OneSky platform (which I am using for my other projects) and if you want to add/update/check any localization follow [this link](https://rekundevelopment.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project?id=336657) to start. I will decline all pull requests with your localizations and will accept only OneSky versions, which I will manually add in new updates.

## FAQ
**Does application require Root?**

Application doesn't require Root on your device.

**Can it brick my device/console?**

This should not happen when using the "correct" payloads. But I am not responsible for possible problems.
